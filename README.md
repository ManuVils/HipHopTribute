# üéß HipHopTribute

During the last week of the bootcamp Code For All, we were challenged with a 24-hour coding challenge, or Hackathon, to be performed in group.

As the bootcamp was reaching it's end, this was the perfect oportunity to put into practice the skills I've learned.

## üèÜ And we won, by the way üèÜ

The theme? The Superbowl Halftime Show. Our halftime? The 2022 one, with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blidge and Kendrick Lamar. 
Ok but what to do with this? We had no limits to what we could do, as long as it was related to the show. So picking up the show, we noticed that the performance itself was a sort of tribute to the past (Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blidge and Eminem) and present (Kendrick Lamar) generations of Hip Hop. And so this gave us the idea of continuing that tribute and building a website that would honor what Hip Hop was and what it can be.
